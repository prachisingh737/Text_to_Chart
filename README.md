## Imagine you are a data analyst or a data scientist of a marketing team at an e-commerce company. 
## The company needs to understand customer purchasing behaviors over the last year to tailor their upcoming holiday campaigns. 
## Traditionally, this would involve complex SQL queries, data wrangling in Python, and perhaps building visual dashboards to interpret 
## the results including analyzing spreadsheets, creating charts, and maybe even some statistical analysisâ€”tasks that require considerable time and expertise.

## With the integration of Langchain and LLMs, you can simply ask, "Show me a visualization of monthly sales trends by product category," or "Generate a heatmap of customer activity by region." 
## The system would use the create_pandas_dataframe_agent to process the CSV data, and then dynamically generate visualizations such as line graphs, bar charts, or heatmaps in response to these queries. 
## This not only speeds up the data analysis process but also allows team members who may not be tech-savvy to engage directly with the data and make informed decisions quickly. 
## This approach fosters a more collaborative environment and ensures that strategic decisions are backed by real-time data insights, visually represented for easy comprehension.

## we will be using the following libraries:

# ibm-watson-ai for using LLMs from IBM's watsonx.ai.
# LangChain, langchain-ibm, langchain-experimental for using its agent function to interact with data.
# matplotlib for additional plotting tools.
# seaborn for visualizing the data.
